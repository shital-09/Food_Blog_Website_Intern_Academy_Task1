        <h2 class="title">Shahi Paneer Recipe</h2>
        <p>Yesterday, I made Shahi paneer to go with homemade kulcha for dinner. I usually make a large batch of paneer
            and freeze the cubed paneer in ziplock bags. As and when I require, I thaw a batch of paneer, place the
            paneer cubes in warm water and am good to go. To learn how to make paneer from scratch, follow the paneer
            recipe I have blogged earlier. After I posted the homemade paneer recipe, I have been receiving emails to
            post easy paneer recipes and special dishes to serve for get togethers and parties.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Dhokla recipe – tips to make soft & spongy dhokla in cooker</h2>
        <p>A rich paneer dish that is apt to serve on special occasions is shahi paneer. It is a rich, onion-cashew nut
            paneer gravy dish that makes for a flavorful side with roti, naan, kulcha, paratha or pulao. The key to this
            fragrant curry is to use blanched onions and freshly ground spices. Usually tomato and turmeric powder are
            avoided to lend the dish a white shade.</p>
        <p>I did not saute the paneer in ghee/butter before adding to the simmering gravy. I soaked the paneer cubes in
            luke warm water for a few minutes and added them to the simmering curry. The paneer is cooked to perfection
            in the spiced gravy and attains a melt in the mouth texture. If you are throwing a party, do add this dish
            to your menu. This restaurant style shahi paneer will please your guests</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Shahi Paneer</h2>

        <p>Blanch the onions and grind to make a paste. If using tomato, blanch it and grind to a paste. Set aside. (I
            have provided the link on how to blanch onions above)

            Grind cashew nuts along with the milk to a smooth paste and set aside.

            Heat oil and ghee in a heavy bottomed vessel. Once hot, add the bay leaf, cinnamon and black cardamom. Add
            the ground onion paste and saute for 6 mts.

            Add ginger-green chili paste, turmeric powder and kasuri methi and saute for 4 mts. Add the tomato puree and
            cook for 6-7 mts.

            Add the cashew nut paste, mix well and cook for a mt. Add the beaten curd and mix well. Add a cup of water
            and allow to simmer for 4 mts on low flame.

            Add paneer cubes and mix gently. Simmer for 8-10 minutes and add the ground garam masala powder and mix.
            Finally add the fresh cream and mix. Turn off flame and allow the curry to rest for 15 mts.

            Remove to a serving bowl. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve warm with kulcha, butter naan, roti
            or pulao.</p>

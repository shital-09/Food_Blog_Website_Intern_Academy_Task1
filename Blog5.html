        <p>Broken wheat upma recipe, a simple, easy to make, healthy, filling and tasty breakfast or evening tiffin
            using minimal ingredients</p>
        <p>Broken wheat upma is the simplest South Indian breakfast one can ever make. It is my go-to breakfast when I
            am rushed for time and need a healthy yet filling meal to see me through the day. This fibre rich dish makes
            for a great evening tiffin or light dinner option when my fridge is almost empty (one of those rare
            occasions).

            In Andhra, we call finer version of broken wheat as godhuma nooka or samba rava and is popular among the
            Telugu speaking folks. It is called dalia in Hindi and godhumai ravai in Tamil. In our home, I usually use
            cracked wheat to make dalia khichdi, kheer, vegetable khara bath, godhuma rava tomato upma and other upma
            variations. Majority frown upon upma but I love it when served hot off the stove.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">How to achieve the authentic, unique flavor of kanchipuram idli</h2>
        <p>Broken wheat upma is super simple to make using minimal ingredients. I dry roast the cracked wheat in a
            little ghee, use cinnamon and cloves to flavour the upma and use a combination of ghee and oil for the
            tempering. These three steps are essential to enhance the flavor of the humble upma. I sometimes throw in a
            few chopped carrots and beans for added nutrition. This diabetic friendly grain needs more water to cook
            than the normal semolina or upma rava. For one cup of finer version of broken wheat, you need to add two and
            quarter cups of water for the grain to cook well. The resultant upma has a loose, dry texture. For a sticky,
            gooey upma, add 2 1/2 to 2 3/4 cups of water for 1 cup of broken wheat.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Broken Wheat Upma Recipe</h2>

        <p>Heat 1/2 tbsp ghee in a cooking vessel, add the broken wheat and toast it on low flame for 6-7 mins. Turn off
            heat and wash it thoroughly. Drain water and set aside.

            Heat the remaining oil and ghee in a cooking vessel, add the mustard seeds and allow to splutter. Add cumin
            seeds, cinnamon stick, cloves, asafoetida and curry leaves and saute them till a nice aroma emanates the
            kitchen.

            Add the chopped onions, green chilis, and ginger and saute for 4 min.

            Add the turmeric powder and mix. Add the chopped tomatoes and saute on medium heat for 4 min. Add 4 1/2 cups
            of hot water and bring to a boil. (be careful as you add the hot water to the cracked wheat, it will
            splutter)

            Reduce heat and slowly add the cracked wheat to the water and stir it continuously so that lumps don’t form
            and it combines well with the water.

            Place lid and simmer for 20-22 mins or till the water is completely evaporated and the upma is done. Turn
            off heat and remove to a serving bowl.

            Garnish with coriander leaves if using and serve warm with pickle or chutney of your choice.</p>

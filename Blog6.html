        <p>basundi recipe – how to make basundi, indian sweet recipes for festivals like diwali, holis</p>
        <p>Basundi recipe is almost the same as rabdi aka rabri, the recipe of which I had posted earlier. Basundi is
            thick sweetened milk that is flavored with cardamom or saffron and garnished with nuts like pistachios or
            chironji. Rabri is similar to basundi but differs in texture due to the difference in the method of
            preparation.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Ingredient</h2>
        <div class="image">
            <p class="left">Ingredients
                Full fat milk 2 lts<br>
                Sugar 1/2 cup (you can reduce by another tbsp)<br>
                Cardamom powder 1/2 tsp<br>
                Saffron 7-8 strands (soaked in 2 tbsps of warm milk)<br>
                Pistachios fistful<br>
                Almonds 7-8, blanched and peeled<br>
                Chironji 1/2 tbsp<br><br>
                1)Use a heavy bottomed vessel while making basundi.<br>
                2)Full fat milk is best for a rich, creamy flavor. You can use 2% milk but it will be less creamy.<br>
                3)You refrigerate for 4-7 days or freeze it for a few weeks.<br></p>

        <h2 class="heading">Dhokla recipe – tips to make soft & spongy dhokla in cooker</h2>
        <p>Both basundi and rabdi, call for the use of full fat milk that is slow cooked for long duration with constant
            stirring. For authentic basundi preparation from scratch, whole milk is reduced to a little less than two
            thirds of its original quantity by constant stirring till the milk thickens. It has more liquid content
            compared to rabdi and less milk solids. Basundi is eaten on it own, either warm or chillied and is also be
            served with puri or jalebi. While making rabri recipe, whole milk is reduced to less than half of its
            original quantity. It is thick with milk solids and has minimal liquid content compared to basundi. Rabri
            can be eaten on its own, either warm or chilled and is also served with malpua.</p>
        <p>This traditonal basundi recipe is a special Indian sweet prepared during festivals in western part of India
            especially Maharashtra and Gujarat. There are easier and less labour intensive methods to prepare basundi
            but then it would not be authentic. Basundi can be prepared using khoya (mawa), condensed milk, cream and
            evaporated milk powder. We can even flavor the authentic basundi recipe with strawberry, custard apple,
            orange, mango</p>
        <h2 class="heading">Method for making Basundi</h2>

        <p>Sliver the blanched almonds, chop the pistachios and set aside.

            Boil milk in a large heavy bottomed wide vessel on high flame. Once it comes to a boil, reduce flame to low
            and allow to simmer for 12-15 mts, stirring in intervals of 3 mts.

            Add sugar at this point and keep stirring constantly. You will see that the milk thickens. This could take
            45 to 50 mts.

            Add cardamom powder and mix well. Turn off flame and allow to cool down slightly. Remove to a serving bowl.

            Garnish with the chopped nuts and saffron strands.

            Ladle into serving bowls and serve warm. You can even chill the rabdi and serve it chilled.</p>

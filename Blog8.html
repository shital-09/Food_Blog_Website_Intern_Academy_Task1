        <p>Bhindi fry recipe, a simple, healthy everyday North Indian style okra dry saute that’s perfect as a side for
            rice and chapati and its vegan too
        </p>
        <p>I cook okra or ladies finger very often since it is one of the most favorite vegetables of our family. I love
            bhindi, love to cook it, eat it and serve it too. Bhindi is a staple in Indian cooking with almost all
            the regional cuisines of India boasting of a variety of dishes in the form of a stir-fry, curry, masala,
            stuffed or deep-fried. I most often make stir fries tweaking the spices each time I cook bhindi. But I
            always come back to a very straightforward, super easy, simple bhindi fry recipe that is a family favorite.
            It goes well with rice, curd rice, and chapati.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">The key to cooking tasty simple bhindi fry Indian style</h2>
        <p>Always wash and pat dry the bhindi before you chop it. Chop the top and tail ends of each bhindi/okra. Cut
            okra into 1″ pieces and spread out on a plate for a few minutes, approx 3-4 mins so that it is free of any
            moisture.
            Cook the okra on high flame for the first 3 minutes and then reduce flame to low medium. Do not place lid
            while cooking bhindi.</p>
        <p>Add lemon juice or a tbsp of buttermilk during the first few minutes to cut down on the slime.
            Do not mix the bhindi often as it tends to become mushy.
            Add salt towards the end of the cooking process.
